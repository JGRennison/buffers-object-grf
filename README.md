# Buffers (slope and ground type aware) NewGRF

### Features

* This GRF adds buffer objects which use the underlying ground type, and which support being placed on slopes without unnecessary foundations.

### Requirements

* This GRF requires a non-standard version of OpenTTD which supports the object use land ground and edge foundation modes, such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.44.2 or later.

### Development

* Compiling requires a forked verison of NML with additional features from [here](https://github.com/JGRennison/nml).
* For NewGRF development details of the non-standard object properties used in this GRF see:
    * [NML specification additions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches/blob/jgrpp/docs/newgrf-additions-nml.html).
